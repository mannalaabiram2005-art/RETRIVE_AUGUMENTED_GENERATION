    "\n",
    "RAG stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was introduced in the paper [*Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each step can be roughly broken down to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Retrieval** - Seeking relevant information from a source given a query. For example, getting relevant passages of Wikipedia text from a database given a question.\n",
    "* **Augmented** - Using the relevant retrieved information to modify an input to a generative model (e.g. an LLM).\n",
    "* **Generation** - Generating an output given an input. For example, in the case of an LLM, generating a passage of text given an input prompt."

Inside the intestinal cells, the  monoglycerides and fatty acids reassemble themselves into  triglycerides. Triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids form  lipoproteins when joined with a protein carrier. Lipoproteins have  an inner core that is primarily made up of triglycerides and  cholesterol esters (a cholesterol ester is a cholesterol linked to a  fatty acid). The outer envelope is made of phospholipids  interspersed with proteins and cholesterol. Together they form a  chylomicron, which is a large lipoprotein that now enters the  lymphatic system and will soon be released into the bloodstream  via the jugular vein in the neck. Chylomicrons transport food fats  perfectly through the body’s water-based environment to specific  destinations such as the liver and other body tissues.  Cholesterols  are  poorly  absorbed  when  compared  to  phospholipids and triglycerides. Cholesterol absorption is aided by  an increase in dietary fat components and is hindered by high fiber  content. This is the reason that a high intake of fiber is  322  |  Digestion and Absorption of Lipids'},\n",

The heart is still working but it is not  meeting the body’s demand for blood and oxygen. If left  unchecked, it can progress to further levels of malfunction.  • Arrhythmia. This is an abnormal rhythm of the heart. The heart  may beat above one hundred beats per minute (known as  tachycardia) or below sixty beats per minute (known as  bradycardia), or the beats are not regular. The heart may not  be able to pump enough volume of blood to meet the body’s  needs.  • Heart valve problems. Stenosis is a condition wherein the heart  valves become compromised in their ability to open wide  enough to allow proper blood flow. When the heart valves do  not close tightly and blood begins to leak between chambers,  this is called regurgitation. When valves bulge or prolapse back  into the upper chamber, this condition is called mitral valve  prolapse.  • Obesity. Obesity is defined as the excessive accumulation of  body fat. According to US Surgeon General Richard Carmona,  obesity is the fastest growing cause of death in America. The  HHS reports that the number of adolescents who are  overweight has tripled since 1980 and the prevalence of the  disease among younger children has doubled2.  • Obesity has been linked to increased risks of developing  diabetes and heart disease.

The energy obtained from the  breaking of chemical bonds in the citric acid cycle is transformed  into two more ATP molecules (or equivalents thereof) and high  energy electrons that are carried by the molecules, nicotinamide  adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and flavin adenine dinucleotide  (FADH2). NADH and FADH2 carry the electrons to the inner  membrane in the mitochondria where the third stage of energy  release takes place, in what is called the electron transport chain. In  this metabolic pathway a sequential transfer of electrons between  multiple proteins occurs and ATP is synthesized. The entire process  of nutrient catabolism is chemically similar to burning, as carbon  and hydrogen atoms are\\xa0 combusted (oxidized) producing carbon  dioxide, water, and heat. However, the stepwise chemical reactions  in nutrient catabolism pathways slow the oxidation of carbon atoms  so that much of the energy is captured and not all transformed into  heat and light. Complete nutrient catabolism is between 30 and 40  percent efficient, and some of the energy is therefore released as  heat. Heat is a vital product of nutrient catabolism and is involved in  maintaining body temperature.

      "Macronutrients Nutrients that are needed in large amounts are called macronutrients.There are three classes of macronutrients: carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins.These can be metabolically processed into cellular energy.The energy from macronutrients comes from their chemical bonds.This chemical energy is converted into cellular energy that is then utilized to perform work, allowing our bodies to conduct their basic functions.A unit of measurement of food energy is the calorie.On nutrition food labels the amount given for “calories” is actually equivalent to each calorie multiplied by one thousand.A kilocalorie (one thousand calories, denoted with a small “c”) is synonymous with the “Calorie” (with a capital “C”) on nutrition food labels.Water is also a macronutrient in the sense that you require a large amount of it, but unlike the other macronutrients, it does not yield calories. Carbohydrates Carbohydrates are molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.\n",

      "Water There is one other nutrient that we must have in large quantities: water.Water does not contain carbon, but is composed of two hydrogens and one oxygen per molecule of water.More than 60 percent of your total body weight is water.Without it, nothing could be transported in or out of the body, chemical reactions would not occur, organs would not be cushioned, and body temperature would fluctuate widely.On average, an adult consumes just over two liters of water per day from food and drink combined.Since water is so critical for life’s basic processes, the amount of water input and output is supremely important, a topic we will explore in detail in Chapter 4. Micronutrients Micronutrients are nutrients required by the body in lesser amounts, but are still essential for carrying out bodily functions. Micronutrients include all the essential minerals and vitamins. There are sixteen essential minerals and thirteen vitamins (See Table 1.1 “Minerals and Their Major Functions” and Table 1.2 “Vitamins and Their Major Functions” for a complete list and their major functions).In contrast to carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins, micronutrients are not sources of energy (calories), but they assist in the process as cofactors or components of enzymes (i.e., coenzymes).\n",

      "Learning Objectives By the end of this chapter, you will be able to: • Describe basic concepts in nutrition • Describe factors that affect your nutritional needs • Describe the importance of research and scientific methods to understanding nutrition What are Nutrients? The foods we eat contain nutrients.Nutrients are substances required by the body to perform its basic functions.Nutrients must be obtained from our diet, since the human body does not synthesize or produce them.Nutrients have one or more of three basic functions: they provide energy, contribute to body structure, and/or regulate chemical processes in the body.These basic functions allow us to detect and respond to environmental surroundings, move, excrete wastes, respire (breathe), grow, and reproduce.There are six classes of nutrients required for the body to function and maintain overall health.These are carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, water, vitamins, and minerals.Foods also contain non-nutrients that may be harmful (such as natural toxins common in plant foods and additives like some dyes and preservatives) or beneficial (such as antioxidants). 4 | Introduction\n",

    "        Answer: The fat-soluble vitamins include Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, and Vitamin K. These vitamins are absorbed along with fats in the diet and can be stored in the body's fatty tissue and liver for later use. Vitamin A is important for vision, immune function, and skin health. Vitamin D plays a critical role in calcium absorption and bone health. Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage. Vitamin K is essential for blood clotting and bone metabolism.\n",
    "        \\nExample 2:\n",
    "        Query: What are the causes of type 2 diabetes?\n",
    "        Answer: Type 2 diabetes is often associated with overnutrition, particularly the overconsumption of calories leading to obesity. Factors include a diet high in refined sugars and saturated fats, which can lead to insulin resistance, a condition where the body's cells do not respond effectively to insulin. Over time, the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to manage blood sugar levels, resulting in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, excessive caloric intake without sufficient physical activity exacerbates the risk by promoting weight gain and fat accumulation, particularly around the abdomen, further contributing to insulin resistance.\n",
    "        \\nExample 3:\n",
    "        Query: What is the importance of hydration for physical performance?\n",
    "        Answer: Hydration is crucial for physical performance because water plays key roles in maintaining blood volume, regulating body temperature, and ensuring the transport of nutrients and oxygen to cells. Adequate hydration is essential for optimal muscle function, endurance, and recovery. Dehydration can lead to decreased performance, fatigue, and increased risk of heat-related illnesses, such as heat stroke. Drinking sufficient water before, during, and after exercise helps ensure peak physical performance and recovery.\n",

      "- The Digestive System UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI‘I AT MĀNOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM The process of digestion begins even before you put food into your mouth.When you feel hungry, your body sends a message to your brain that it is time to eat.Sights and smells influence your body’s preparedness for food.Smelling food sends a message to your brain. Your brain then tells the mouth to get ready, and you start to salivate in preparation for a meal. Once you have eaten, your digestive system (Figure 2.4 “The Human Digestive System”) starts the process that breaks down the components of food into smaller components that can be absorbed and taken into the body.To do this, the digestive system functions on two levels, mechanically to move and mix ingested food and chemically to break down large molecules.The smaller nutrient molecules can then be absorbed and processed by cells throughout the body for energy  or used as building blocks for new cells.The digestive system is one of the eleven organ systems of the human body, and it is composed of several hollow tube-shaped organs including the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine (colon), rectum, and anus.It is lined with mucosal tissue that secretes digestive juices (which aid in the breakdown of food) and mucus (which facilitates the propulsion of food through the tract).\n",

      "- Metabolic pathways of a cell down, it is not metabolically efficient for a cell to synthesize fatty acids and break them down at the same time. Catabolism of food molecules begins when food enters the mouth, as the enzyme salivary amylase initiates the breakdown of the starch in foods.The entire process of digestion converts the large polymers in food to monomers that can be absorbed.Starches are broken down to monosaccharides, lipids are broken down to fatty acids, and proteins are broken down to amino acids.These monomers are absorbed into the bloodstream either directly, as is the case with monosaccharides and amino acids, or repackaged in intestinal cells for transport by an indirect route through lymphatic vessels, as is the case with most fatty acids and other fat-soluble molecules. Once absorbed, water-soluble nutrients first travel to the liver which controls their passage into the blood that transports the nutrients to cells throughout the body.The fat-soluble nutrients gradually pass from the lymphatic vessels into blood flowing to body cells.Cells requiring energy or building blocks take up the nutrients from the blood and process them in either catabolic or anabolic pathways.The organ systems of the body require fuel and building blocks to perform the many functions of the body, such as digesting, absorbing, breathing, pumping blood, transporting nutrients in and wastes out, maintaining body temperature, and making new cells.
